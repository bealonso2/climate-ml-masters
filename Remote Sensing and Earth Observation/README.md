# Remote Sensing and Earth Observation

In this chapter, we explore the fundamental tools and techniques for remote sensing and earth observation. We'll work with both raster and vector data, covering various practical applications relevant to climate and environmental monitoring. These skills are essential for understanding, analyzing, and making informed decisions based on satellite and geospatial data.

As always, you are encouraged to dive deeper wherever you see fit!

## Foundations of Remote Sensing

Remote sensing is the use of satellites or aircraft to observe the Earth's surface. These observations help us measure and monitor features like vegetation health, snow cover, flood events, wildfire activity, and other critical environmental factors.

### Key Concepts

- **Sensor Types**: Different types of sensors capture imagery at different wavelengths, such as optical, infrared, and radar.

- **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**: This index measures vegetation health by analyzing how plants reflect light at certain wavelengths.

- **NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index)**: This index is used to detect snow cover by distinguishing between snow and other materials.

- **Multi-band Imagery**: Imagery that contains multiple layers, each representing different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

## Working with Raster Data

Raster data is the most common format for remote sensing imagery, representing the Earth's surface in grids of pixels, each with a value representing a specific property like temperature or reflectance.

### Key Tools and Datasets

- **[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/)**: A powerful tool for working with large satellite datasets like **Landsat**, **Sentinel**, and **MODIS**.
- **Python Libraries**: Tools like **Rasterio** and **Geopandas** make it easy to manipulate and analyze raster data.

## Project: Working with Raster Data to Understand NDVI and NDSI

In the first project, we'll use Google Earth Engine to calculate NDVI and NDSI for a selected region using Landsat imagery. This will provide a hands-on understanding of vegetation health and snow cover analysis.

## Project: Another Raster Exampleâ€”Maui Wildfire Analysis

In this project, we'll analyze the extent of a wildfire in Maui using Sentinel-2 imagery. We'll calculate the **Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)** to identify the burned area. This project will give you a practical understanding of the challenges producing high-quality images for wildfire monitoring.

## Vector-Based Spatial Data Analysis

Vector data consists of points, lines, and polygons that represent various features like cities, roads, or power grid infrastructure. Analyzing vector data allows us to make meaningful conclusions about spatial relationships.

### Key Tools

- **GeoPandas**: A Python library for handling and analyzing vector data.
- **QGIS**: A powerful open-source GIS tool for visualizing and processing geospatial data.
- **Shapely**: A Python package for geometric operations like buffering and spatial joins.

### Project: Flood Risk Assessment Using Vector Data

In this project, we will use **GeoPandas**, **Shapely**, and **folium** to map flood risk zones and assess the impact on land use and population. This analysis is crucial for disaster response planning and understanding the spatial relationships between infrastructure, population, and environmental risks.
