### How the Course Works

The goal of each chapter is to provide an overview of the topic and teach you just enough to get started. You are encouraged to explore the topics in more depth on your own!

This course is designed to be hands-on, so each chapter will have a folder of notebooks called `Start` and `Complete`.

- The `Start` notebooks will point you to the correct dataset and have markdown sections explaining what to implement in the code blocks.

- The `Complete` notebooks will have the full code implementation--at least how I completed it :).

## How to Get the Most Out of This Program

### Show Your Work!

- **Build a Portfolio**: Showcase your projects (e.g., disaster detection models, carbon-aware systems) on GitHub.

- **Publish Your Work**: Write blog posts or reports on Medium/X (Twitter) to share insights and get feedback.

### Join the Community

- **Network in Climate AI Communities**: Engage with [**Climate Change AI**](https://community.climatechange.ai/home), **Climate Trace partners**, and other climate tech networks.

- **Participate in Competitions and Hackathons**: Join challenges related to remote sensing, emissions tracking, or energy forecasting.
